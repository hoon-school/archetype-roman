# `roman`

Template repository for HSL competition.

**Please _do not fork this repository directly on GitHub._**  Instead, please use GitHub's "template" function following [the instructions below](#creating-a-repository) to copy this repository and customize it for your project.

## Creating a Repository

1.  Log in to GitHub.
    (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.)
    You must be logged in for the remaining steps to work.

2.  On this page (<https://github.com/hoon-school/archetype-roman/>),
    click on the green "Use this template" button (top right)

3.  Select the owner for your new repository.
    (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)

4.  Choose a name for your copy of the archetype repository.
    This name should have the form of the template repo without `archetype`, e.g. `roman` or `hsl-roman`.

5.  Make sure the repository is public, leave "Include all branches" unchecked, and click
on "Create repository from template".
You will be redirected to your new copy of the template respository.

After this is complete, you can use this repo to handle your competition development and submission.
